CODING STYLE
============

Please adhere strictly to the guidelines specified in this coding style document when
coding in this project.  Coding style guide by Jez (will be updated as and when):

- Code in C#.
- Local members must begin with a lowercase character, public members must begin with
  an uppercase character.
- When opening a block after an initial if() statement, the opening bracket must be on
  the same line as the if(); begin the else statement on a new line from the closing
  bracket of the if() block (see examples below).  Likewise with other statements like
  while(), again the opening bracket must be on the same line as the while().  Yeah,
  they're not Microsoft's standards, but I prefer them!
  
  Example (WRONG):
	if (a == b)
	{
		doSomething();
	}
	else
	{
		doOtherthing();
	}
  
  Example (CORRECT):
	if (a == b) {
		doSomething();
	}
	else {
		doOtherthing();
	}
  
- If there are only 1 or 2 simple statements in a block, the whole block can go on the
  same line.  You must ALWAYS use brackets for a block, and NEVER use the ability to
  avoid brackets with a single statement after something like an if() (see examples
  below).  Frankly, I wish they'd abolished the 'no brackets' thing in C#.
  
  Example (WRONG):
	if (a == b)
		xyz();
  
  Example (WRONG):
	if (a == b) xyz();
  
  Example (CORRECT):
	if (a == b) { xyz(); }
  
  Example (CORRECT):
	while (a < b) { writeLine(a.toString()); a++; }
  
  Example (CORRECT):
	while (a > b) {
		if (a-- == 0) { writeLine("b is under zero."); break; }
	}
  
- ALWAYS use tabs for indentation at the beginning of a line.  ALWAYS use spaces for
  any indentation of comments, enum values, etc. at the end of a line.
  
  Example (CORRECT):
	public enum Breads : int {
		White     = 0,
		Brown     = 1,
		Danish    = 2,
		Baguette  = 3,
		Pitta     = 4,
		Naan      = 5,
	}
  
  Example (CORRECT):
	if (formIsVisible) {
		cleanUp();                           // Clean things up
		displayLine("Closing form 123...");  // Display closing message to user
		closeForm();                         // Finally, close the form
	}
  
- ALWAYS finish the last member of an enumeration with a comma.
- Make sure blank lines in between others are indented to the same level as the lines
  around them, and are not just empty.  You'll have to highlight whitespace to see the
  difference between the examples.
  
  Example (WRONG):
	statement1;

	if (abc) {
		a = 1;

		b = 2;
	}
  
  Example (CORRECT):
	statement1;
	
	if (abc) {
		a = 1;
		
		b = 2;
	}
  
- Try to group similar methods together and if there are more than a few of them,
  surround them in a #region block.  If they are part of a logical function of a class
  (eg. Constructors), always surround them in a #region block.
- Avoid 'padding' the conditional part of if statements, loops, etc. with spaces.
  
  Example (WRONG):
	while ( i < count ) { displayLine("i: " + i++); }
  
  Example (CORRECT):
	while (i < count) { displayLine("i: " + i++); }
  
- If there's a comment you want to make to remind someone to come back later and
  fix/implement/change something, always put a comment there beginning with 'TODO:'.
- If you're breaking a conditional statement over several lines and connecting several
  conditions with && or || operators, (in general) those operators should be put at
  the end of the line.
  
  Example (WRONG):
	if (
		a == b
		|| c == d
	) {
		doSomething();
	}
  
  Example (CORRECT):
	if (
		a == b ||
		c == d
	) {
		doSomething();
	}
  
- Not quite a coding style guideline, but a guideline all the same: when checking in
  changes to source control, please give a reasonable (concise, but accurate) summary
  of the change(s) you have made in that checkin.
